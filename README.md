# 555 Timer LED Flasher Project 

This project demonstrates a simple **LED flasher circuit** using the classic **NE555 timer IC**.  
The circuit is designed and tested in **Proteus**, and a PCB was created for practical implementation.

##  Project Overview
- **IC Used**: NE555 Timer
- **Mode**: Astable Mode
- **Application**: LED Flasher / Blinker
- **Tools Used**: Proteus (for simulation), EasyEDA/KiCad/Altium (for PCB design)

##  Working Principle
The NE555 timer is configured in **Astable Mode**, meaning it produces a continuous square wave output.  
This square wave makes the LED **blink ON and OFF** at a rate determined by the resistor and capacitor values.


 By changing **R1, R2, or C**, you can adjust the blinking speed.

##  Simulation
The simulation of this project is carried out in **Proteus**.  
You can open the provided `.dsn` file in Proteus to check the working of the LED flasher.
